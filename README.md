# Alpha
Alpha is TomEpsilon's first repository.
You can care about this little thing, or not. I don't care.
## Inside
Inside this thing, you'll see:
* **inter**  
A black and white website, not designed for peoples with epilepsy.
* **gisty**  
A test website that a) has a gist embedded b) has Inter as font (because why not?)  
* **rando**  
A website and python file that generates random colors, again not designed for peoples with epilepsy.
